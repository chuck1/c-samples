/* Example for PC game developers to show how to *combine* texturing,
   reflections, and projected shadows all in real-time with OpenGL.
   Robust reflections use stenciling.  Robust projected shadows
   use both stenciling and polygon offset.  PC game programmers
   should realize that neither stenciling nor polygon offset are 
   supported by Direct3D, so these real-time rendering algorithms
   are only really viable with OpenGL. 

   The program has modes for disabling the stenciling and polygon
   offset uses.  It is worth running this example with these features
   toggled off so you can see the sort of artifacts that result.

   Notice that the floor texturing, reflections, and shadowing
   all co-exist properly. */

/* When you run this program:  Left mouse button controls the
   view.  Middle mouse button controls light position (left &
   right rotates light around dino; up & down moves light
   position up and down).  Right mouse button pops up menu. */

/* Check out the comments in the "redraw" routine to see how the
   reflection blending and surface stenciling is done.  You can
   also see in "redraw" how the projected shadows are rendered,
   including the use of stenciling and polygon offset. */
